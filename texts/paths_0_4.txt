You decide to go to the blacksmith

You walk past the housing of guards and servants to the throne.
When you get to the blacksmith, the door is already open and you walk right in.
The blacksmith, Alder, looks up at you as if he was expecting you.
"So, you today? I was expecting someone," he says, "Your weapons and armor gone?"

You respond, "Yes, how di-"

"You're the seventh one this week. There seems to be a bandit targeting the guards.
Unfortuantily, I cannot replace your weapons any time soon. You will need to find armor nad weapons yourself."

You leave

Even though you do not have weapons or armor, the castle needs to be defended.
Although, spending the time looking for new gear may also be useful.
