...You wake up to a beautiful morning of rain...and neighborlly disputes between the grounds workers.

As you go to get ready, suited up and all, you realsize that your armor and weapons are gone.
Distraught and disoriented, you run out of your lodge. Immeditaly, you see another guard wearing amour that looks like yours.
