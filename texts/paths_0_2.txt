Your shift is up!"
You talk with Benedict breifly, he warns your of a churning rebellion. Be careful, royal gaurds are targeted during these things.
On your way home you can't help but think of it. What has the King done to provoke this?
The King is Fair, he is a fine King. As is the Queen, Princess, and two Princes. There is nothing wrong with the royal family.
The people of UR are very ungrateful if this rumor is true.

Tomorrow you have the normal shifts in the castle. You should probaly tell a member of the royal house about the rumor.
Maybe the elder, Leighton, from the farm next to the river. You and Leighton, from the farm next to the river, have spoken in the past and have a good relationship.
He is a trustworthy, reasonable man.

You reach your lodging and doze off to sleep...
